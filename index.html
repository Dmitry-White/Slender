                                And now, creating projects like this, I'm on the way to become a well-rounded professional,
                                who always gets things done with beauty and style.

                                Student of BSUIR, faculty of Engineering and Economics.
                                But don't let the faculty name fool you - I'm more of a programmer than an economist.
                                Probably, not an economist at all. Worked as SMM professional, web designer and PR specialist.
                                Today I'm a HTML designer at a small company. I entered BSUIR with a clear goal in my mind -
                                to become a web developer. And here I'm, slowly making my dreams come true.

                            <p>
                                In vanilla Slender game all you have to do, as human, is to collect eight pieces of paper scattered among trees and bushes.
                                The more you pick up, the harder it gets to avoid the strange slender figure,
                                creeping you out with static radio noises from a distance. When he comes in contact with you,
                                it turns you around and ends the game. But have you ever wondered how it looks like from Slender's perspective?
                                Place mysterious papers on the ground to lure humans and kill them as they pause to look at the paper.

                            <p>
                                This game is a product of teamwork and collaborative programming.
                                There's no clear distinction between who wrote what.
                                When new functionality was added by one developer,
                                the other one dived head first into the piece of code and improved it
                                with his fresh look and perspective. This approach eliminated bias in the game
                                and made it feel like a truly unique and balanced experience.
