## Description
A pseudo 3D game with HTML5 Canvas, CoreJS and Raycasting

## Story
In vanilla Slender game all you have to do, as human, is to collect eight pieces of paper scattered among trees and bushes.
The more you pick up, the harder it gets to avoid the strange slender figure,
creeping you out with static radio noises from a distance. When he comes in contact with you,
it turns you around and ends the game. But have you ever wondered how it looks like from Slender's perspective?
Place mysterious papers on the ground to lure humans and kill them as they pause to look at the paper.
                            
### Local Usage
```
npm install
npm run game
```
